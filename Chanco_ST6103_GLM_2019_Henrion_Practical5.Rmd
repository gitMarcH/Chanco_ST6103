## Practical 5: Generalised Linear Models


# Exercise 1

Derive the deviance for a binomial GLM with logit link function and then derive the deviance residuals.

# Exercise 2

Go back to the contraceptive use Poisson GLM with interaction term fitted in Practical 4.

Compute the various diagnostic metrics & figures.

Discuss the results.
