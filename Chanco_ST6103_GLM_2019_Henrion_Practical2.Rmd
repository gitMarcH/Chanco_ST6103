## Practical 2: Generalised Linear Models using R

# Exercise 1

Download the file `byHandExample1.csv` from the GitHub repository.
$$\,$$
Use `read.csv()` or `read.table()` to read this dataset into `R`.
$$\,$$

Use the R functions `lm()` or `glm()` to fit the same linear model as we did yesterday when we calculated $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ by hand.
$$\,$$

* Convince yourself you get the same results.

* What difference - if any - do you observe between using `lm()` and `glm()`?

* Find out more about these r functions by typing `?lm` and `?glm`.


# Exercise 2

Manually code up the data from yesterday's Exercise 2 in Practical 1.

Then refit the same model from yesterday using `R`.

* Convince yourself you get the same results.

* Calculate $R^2$.



# Exercise 3

Load the `mtcars` dataset by typing `data(mtcars)`. Get information about this dataset by typing `?mtcars`.

* Explore this dataset: produce histograms & scatterplots. 

* You want to find out which variables are most important to achieve a high miles per gallon rating in a car. Use `R` to build a GLM model regressing the `mpg` variables on `hp` (horsepower), `disp` (displacement),`cyl` (cylinders) and `wt` (weight). Interpret the model output.

* Buid a model that would allow you to predict whether a car has manual or automatic transmission. Specifically, regress `am` (transmission) on `hp` (horse power) and `wt` (weight). Be careful to specify a binomial distribution with logit link! What about a log link? Identity link?

Discuss (and explore!) your model results. What other variables would you consider including into the models?
